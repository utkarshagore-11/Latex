	\subsection{Subsection:TeX and LaTeX}
	\paragraph{}
	TeX is a typesetting computer program created by Donald Knuth, originally for his magnum opus, The Art of Computer Programming. It takes a "plain" text file and converts it into a high-quality document for printing or on-screen viewing. LaTeX is a macro system built on top of TeX that aims to simplify its use and automate many common formatting tasks. It is the de-facto standard for academic journals and books in several fields, such as mathematics and physics, and provides some of the best typography free software has to offer.
